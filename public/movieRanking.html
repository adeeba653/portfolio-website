 <p>I loved this anime. It's a great watch when you just want to relax not much drama Just a sweet little piece of art.</p>

 <h3>A Time Called You</h3>

 <p>This was an amazing korean sci-fi series. It showed how True Love does make you do anything to get your love back once you've lost it.</p>

 <h3>Little Women</h3>
 <img src="../assets/images/littlewomen.jpg" height = 450 alt="little women image.">
 <p>It was a very inspiring story of four sisters each with their own abilities and pursuits. I loved how each of them did exactly what they wanted to even after so many difficulties faced by each one of them. My favourite line from the movie :<br />
    <em>"I just feel like Women...  they have minds and they have souls as well as just hearts and they've got ambitions, and they've got talent ,as well as just beauty And I'm so sick of people saying that love is all a women is fit for. I'm so sick of it...But I'm so lonely.</em></p>

 <h3>Anne With An E</h3>

 <p>This was an amazing series, probably the one that will stuck in my head forever. My favourite line from this series :<br />
    <em>"Tell me, and I forget. Teach me, and I remember. Involve me, and I learn".</em></p>
